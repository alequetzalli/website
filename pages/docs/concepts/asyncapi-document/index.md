The AsyncAPI document is a YAML or JSON file that describes your implementation of the AsyncAPI specification. Providing a standardized way to document and describe asynchronous and event-driven systems, the AsyncAPI document generates documentation/code and defines the different components of your event-driven application, such as the events, channels, and message formats.

Primarily, it provides a method to produce comprehensive, consistent, and standardized AsyncAPI documentation. Additionally, it serves as a contract for communication between consumers and producers in an event-driven system. It specifies what should be included in the payload when a service produces a message and provides information to the consumer about the properties in the message. 

```YAML
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Cool Example
  version: 0.1.0
channels:
  user/signedup:
    subscribe:
      message:
        description: An event describing that a user just signed up.
        payload:
          type: object
          additionalProperties: false
          properties:
            fullName:
              type: string
            email:
              type: string
              format: email
            age:
              type: integer
              minimum: 18
```

## AsyncAPI document components

The AsyncAPI document follows a specific structure with certain headers or fields:

- **`asyncapi`**: This is a required field that specifies the AsyncAPI specification version that your document adheres to.

- **`info`**: This required field holds metadata about the API. The `info` section must include the following sub-fields:
   
   - `title`: A descriptive title of the API.
   
   - `version`: An API version identifier.
   
   Optional fields within the `info` section could include `description`, `termsOfService`, `contact` (with subfields for `name`, `url`, `email`), and `license` (with `name` and `url` subfields).

- **`servers`**: An optional field specifying the server(s) where the API is available. Each server must have a `url` and may have `protocol`, `protocolVersion`, `description`, `variables`, `security`, and `bindings`.

- **`channels`**: This required field describes the paths available to the API and must include at least one channel. Each channel could include fields such as `description`, `subscribe`, `publish`, `parameters`, and `bindings`.

- **`components`**: An optional section for defining reusable components like `messages`, `schemas`, `securitySchemes`, and others.

- **`tags`**: An optional array of tags used by the specification with additional metadata. Each tag object can have `name` and `description`.

- **`externalDocs`**: An optional section to provide more information, such as a link to the APIâ€™s external documentation with a `description` and a `url`.


<Remember>
You might have additional fields depending on the implemented protocol (i.e., MQTT, AMQP, Kafka, etc.).
